# Test Driven Development (TDD) Guide for Offline-First POS System

## Overview
This project follows Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure high-quality, secure code for our offline-first POS system. TDD involves writing tests before implementing crypto, storage, and sync features, leading to better security, fewer bugs, and easier maintenance.

## TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the crypto/sync behavior.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code to make the crypto test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping crypto tests passing.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **POS/Owner PWA**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- **Crypto Testing**: Custom WebCrypto test utilities with mock keys.
- **Storage Testing**: IndexedDB test helpers with cleanup.
- **Integration**: Playwright for cross-browser E2E, manual offline simulation.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual crypto functions, storage operations, message processing.
- **Integration Tests**: Test crypto + storage + transport interactions.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete offline-to-online sync workflows.
- **Security Tests**: Validate WebCrypto operations, signature verification, replay protection.
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark crypto operations, storage access, sync times.

## Key Testing Areas
- **WebCrypto Operations**: Sign/verify, encrypt/decrypt with various key types.
- **Offline Functionality**: Mock network failures, test queue persistence.
- **Message Security**: Test envelope creation, signature validation, replay protection.
- **Storage Reliability**: IndexedDB operations, quota handling, data integrity.
- **Sync Mechanisms**: WebRTC transport, fallback routing, retry logic.
- **PWA Features**: Service Worker caching, background sync, offline functionality.

## TDD in Phases
For each phase:
1. Identify crypto/storage features from acceptance criteria.
2. Write tests for each security requirement/edge case.
3. Implement code to pass crypto tests.
4. Refactor and re-test with security focus.
5. Update debugging tracker with crypto-related learnings.

## Example TDD Workflow
- **Feature**: Encrypt message payload.
- **Test**: Write test for AES-GCM encryption with WebCrypto.
- **Code**: Implement encrypt/decrypt wrapper functions.
- **Refactor**: Add error handling and key validation.

## Security Testing Focus
- **Key Management**: Test key generation, storage, rotation.
- **Signature Validation**: Test valid/invalid signatures, key mismatches.
- **Encryption**: Test payload encryption/decryption, integrity.
- **Replay Protection**: Test timestamp/nonce validation.
- **Transport Security**: Test WebRTC encryption, fallback security.

## Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every commit with crypto validation.
- Use GitHub Actions for automated crypto and security testing.
- Track test coverage (aim for 80%+ including crypto modules).

## Offline Testing
- **Network Simulation**: Mock offline/online transitions.
- **Storage Testing**: Test IndexedDB with quota limits.
- **Sync Testing**: Test retry logic, fallback mechanisms.
- **PWA Testing**: Test Service Worker caching and background sync.

## Debugging with TDD
- Use tests to isolate crypto bugs and security issues.
- Record failed crypto tests and fixes in `debugging_tracker.md`.
- Avoid regressions by running full crypto test suite.

## Best Practices
- Tests should be fast, isolated, and repeatable.
- Mock external dependencies (WebRTC, Service Worker APIs).
- Test both happy paths and security failure scenarios.
- Validate crypto operations against known test vectors.
- Review and update tests during security refactoring.

## Security Test Examples
```javascript
// Test signature verification
test('should reject tampered message', async () => {
  const tamperedEnvelope = { ...validEnvelope, payload: 'modified' };
  expect(await verifyMessage(tamperedEnvelope)).toBe(false);
});

// Test replay protection
test('should reject duplicate nonce', async () => {
  const duplicateMessage = { ...message, nonce: usedNonce };
  expect(await processMessage(duplicateMessage)).toThrow('Replay detected');
});

// Test encryption roundtrip
test('should encrypt and decrypt payload correctly', async () => {
  const plaintext = 'sensitive sales data';
  const encrypted = await encrypt(plaintext, sharedSecret);
  const decrypted = await decrypt(encrypted, sharedSecret);
  expect(decrypted).toBe(plaintext);
});
```
