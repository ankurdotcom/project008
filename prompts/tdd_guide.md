# Test Driven Development (TDD) Guide for Grocery Shop Chain Sales Tracking

## Overview
This project follows Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure high-quality, reliable code. TDD involves writing tests before implementing features, leading to better design, fewer bugs, and easier maintenance.

## TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **POS (React Native)**: Jest for unit tests, Detox for end-to-end tests.
- **Owner (React PWA)**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests.
- **Integration**: Postman/Newman for API testing, manual testing for Google services.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components (e.g., cart calculations, email parsing).
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules (e.g., sync mechanisms).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test full user flows (e.g., complete sale transaction).
- **Acceptance Tests**: Based on phase acceptance criteria.

## Key Testing Areas
- **Offline Functionality**: Mock network failures, test queueing.
- **Responsive Design**: Test on various screen sizes/devices.
- **Edge Cases**: As listed in each phase (e.g., no internet, duplicates).
- **Performance**: Test on low-end devices, slow connections.
- **Security**: Validate Google API usage, no data leaks.

## TDD in Phases
For each phase:
1. Identify features from acceptance criteria.
2. Write tests for each feature/edge case.
3. Implement code to pass tests.
4. Refactor and re-test.
5. Update debugging tracker with test-related learnings.

## Example TDD Workflow
- **Feature**: Add item to cart.
- **Test**: Write test for adding item, checking quantity.
- **Code**: Implement add-to-cart function.
- **Refactor**: Optimize for performance.

## Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every commit.
- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing.
- Track test coverage (aim for 80%+).

## Debugging with TDD
- Use tests to isolate bugs.
- Record failed tests and fixes in `debugging_tracker.md`.
- Avoid regressions by running full test suite.

## Best Practices
- Tests should be fast, isolated, and repeatable.
- Name tests descriptively (e.g., "should add item to cart").
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., Google APIs).
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios.
- Review and update tests during refactoring.
