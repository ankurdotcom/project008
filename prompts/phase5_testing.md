# Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

## Detailed Prompt for AI Agent
Conduct thorough testing including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Test on low-end devices, slow/intermittent internet. Deploy apps to app stores/browsers. Monitor for issues and update debugging tracker with new learnings. **TDD Step**: Ensure all tests are written and passing; use TDD for any new features discovered during testing. **Principles**: Achieve zero bugs through comprehensive testing, high performance via profiling, and top UX through user testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E).
- Apps deploy successfully (APK for POS, PWA for Owner).
- Performance benchmarks met on low-end devices.
- Offline/online transitions work seamlessly.
- Test coverage meets 80%+.
- UX testing shows high satisfaction.
- No critical bugs in production.
- Zero regressions from previous phases.

## Edge Cases
- Extreme low bandwidth: Test with 2G speeds.
- Device failures: Recovery from crashes.
- Data migration: Handle app updates.
- User errors: Invalid inputs, permissions denied.
- Scalability: Test with 10+ terminals.
- Security: No data leaks in emails/Sheets.

## Demo Requirements
- Present full end-to-end workflow: POS sale → email sync → Owner dashboard update.
- Demonstrate performance on low-end devices and slow connections.
- Show comprehensive test suite execution and coverage reports.
- Display deployed apps (APK installation, PWA in browser).
- Showcase monitoring dashboard for production metrics.
