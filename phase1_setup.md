# Phase 1: Project Setup and Tech Stack Selection

## Detailed Prompt for AI Agent
Set up the initial project structure for the Grocery Shop Chain Sales Tracking system. Analyze the business requirements in `business_requirements.md` and select a lightweight tech stack suitable for low-end devices, mobile browsers, and intermittent/slow internet. Create initial project files, configure build tools, and set up basic folder structures in `pos` and `owner` folders. Ensure the stack supports offline functionality, responsiveness, and seamless online/offline transitions. Use the debugging tracker to reference any prior learnings on tech stack choices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project folders `pos` and `owner` are created with appropriate subfolders (e.g., src, public, assets).
- Tech stack selected: React Native for POS (Android app), React PWA for Owner app.
- Basic project files (package.json, index.js, etc.) are initialized.
- Offline support libraries (e.g., Redux Persist, Service Workers) are configured.
- Build tools (e.g., Metro for RN, Webpack for PWA) are set up.
- README.md updated with setup instructions.
- No errors in initial builds.

## Edge Cases
- Device compatibility: Ensure stack works on Android 5.0+ and modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Low-end devices: Optimize for devices with 1GB RAM or less.
- Intermittent internet: Implement basic offline queueing.
- Slow connections: Use lazy loading and minimal bundle sizes.
- Multiple accounts: Structure for per-device Google account config.
- Free services: Confirm no paid Google APIs are used.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 2 after setup completion.
