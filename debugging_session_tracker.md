# Debugging Session Tracker - POS Interface Issue

## Problem Statement
- **Issue**: No UI interface visible despite successful compilation
- **Expected**: Grocery POS interface with navigation and functionality  
- **Actual**: Blank screen/no interface

## Analysis Framework
### 1. Environment Validation
### 2. Build Process Analysis  
### 3. Network/Server Analysis
### 4. Application Architecture Analysis
### 5. Browser/Client Analysis

## Attempted Solutions Log
| Solution | Date/Time | Result | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Entry point fix (App.tsx → App.js) | Initial | FAILED | Server compiled but no interface |
| Store conflict resolution | Initial | FAILED | Removed warnings but no interface |
| Redux Persist configuration | Initial | FAILED | Clean compilation but no interface |
| Process cleanup + fresh start | Current | PARTIAL | Server starts but stops on connection |

## BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY
**Root Cause**: Expo dev server auto-shutdown behavior
- Server starts correctly ✅
- Compilation succeeds ✅  
- Server stops when curl connects ❌
- Need browser-based testing, not curl ❌

## Next Investigation Areas
1. ~~Browser inspection needed~~ → **PRIORITY**
2. ~~Network requests analysis~~ → Skip, server works
3. ~~JavaScript console errors~~ → **PRIORITY** 
4. ~~React Developer Tools~~ → **PRIORITY**
5. ~~Application mounting verification~~ → **PRIORITY**
