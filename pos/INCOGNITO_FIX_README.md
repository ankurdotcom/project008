# Local Library Setup for Incognito Mode Support

## Problem
The Grocery POS application was failing to load in incognito/private browsing mode because external CDN dependencies (React, ReactDOM, Babel) were being blocked or restricted by the browser's privacy features.

## Solution
Added local copies of all external dependencies with automatic fallback to CDN if local files fail to load.

## Files Added
- `lib/react.development.js` - Local React library (109KB)
- `lib/react-dom.development.js` - Local ReactDOM library (1.08MB)
- `lib/babel.min.js` - Local Babel standalone (3.07MB)
- `test-libraries.html` - Test page to verify local libraries work

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML File (`web-simple.html`)
- Updated script tags to load from local `lib/` directory first
- Added intelligent fallback loader that tries CDN if local files fail
- Improved error handling and async dependency loading
- Enhanced CSP to allow 'unsafe-eval' for Babel

### 2. Server File (`server.js`)
- Added cache control for local library files
- Updated CSP to include 'unsafe-eval' for Babel compatibility
- Ensured static file serving works for lib directory

## How It Works

1. **Primary Load**: Browser attempts to load React, ReactDOM, and Babel from local `lib/` directory
2. **Fallback**: If local files fail (network issues, file corruption), automatically tries CDN
3. **Error Handling**: If both local and CDN fail, shows user-friendly "Limited Mode" with available features
4. **Async Rendering**: App waits for dependencies to load before rendering, preventing race conditions

## Testing

### Test Local Libraries
Visit: `http://localhost:9090/test-libraries.html`

### Test Full Application
1. Open application in normal browser tab - should work as before
2. Open application in incognito/private mode - should now load successfully
3. Disable internet connection - should still work with local files

## Benefits

- ✅ **Incognito Mode Support**: Application works in private browsing
- ✅ **Offline Capability**: No internet required for core functionality
- ✅ **Faster Loading**: Local files load faster than CDN in many cases
- ✅ **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms prevent failures
- ✅ **Security**: Local files are served with proper CSP headers

## File Sizes
- React: ~110KB
- ReactDOM: ~1.1MB
- Babel: ~3.1MB
- **Total**: ~4.3MB (reasonable for modern web applications)

## Maintenance
- Update local libraries periodically by downloading latest versions from unpkg.com
- Monitor browser console for any loading issues
- Test in multiple browsers and incognito modes regularly
