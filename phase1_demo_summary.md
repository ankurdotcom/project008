# Phase 1 Demo Summary

## What Was Accomplished
✅ **Project Structure Created**: Organized folders for POS and Owner apps
✅ **Tech Stack Selected**: React Native (POS) and React PWA (Owner)
✅ **Dependencies Configured**: Package.json files with all necessary libraries
✅ **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist for offline support
✅ **Testing Framework**: Jest configured for both apps
✅ **Navigation**: React Navigation (POS) and React Router (Owner)
✅ **Offline Support**: Redux Persist and Service Workers implemented

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Phase 2: POS Terminal Development
- Install dependencies: `npm install` in both folders
- Start development: `npm start` (Owner) / `npm run android` (POS)
- Begin implementing core POS features

## Key Technologies Implemented
